## My process

### Built with

- REACT
- Flexbox
- CSS
- Mobile first


### What I learned

-Destructuring - I had briefly used it during a FCC lesson but I didn't really understand what I was doing or why. Now I feel more comfortable with simple applications of it and have a basic understanding of what is happening.
-useState - since I am still a beginner with React, this was a concept I wanted to better understand.


### Challenges
-Getting images to render from JSON


### Continued development
-Add ability to pull data from outside data and not my own
-Add ability to add birthdays
-Figure out how to get images to load from JSON


### Useful resources
